# Day 2

### Schedule:

* Review

  * Mynah: - really good to review, they can apply things much better when they sleep on it
            - they had fun practicing something they already knew
  * Suha: - yes they were more relaxed as well
          - gives us the mentors a better picture of what they understand

* Loops and Threads Workshop part 1/2

          - they didn't want to stop working
  * Suha: they loved it, and I loved it! :D

* Loops and Threads Workshop part 2/2

  * Suha: I was really impressed on how well they understood threads
  * Mynah: me too! might need to solidify the knowledge so they feel comfortable to apply it

* Video of SonicPi performance

  * Mynah: - maybe not the best video [Coding Dub Techno with SonicPi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1RxpJkvqpY)
  * Suha: - maybe not show them something so advanced
          - in general, videos are a good idea and they did like it
          - was good to ask them questions about it after, they recognized things that they learned

* Scratch

  * Mynah: - maybe we should give them the choice between Scratch and SonicPi
            - some of them were a bit bored by it because they use it in school
  * Suha: - we should continue with it, not everyone knows how to use it well
          - we should give them exercises with it but for the first day  we use it it was really good to give them
          freedom because they were really creative
