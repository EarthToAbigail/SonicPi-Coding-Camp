# Day 1

@MynahMarie
@Suuuuha

### Schedule:

* Presentation:

  Suha: maybe too short but was not much to add to it, was good
  Mynah: maybe too formal?
  Suha: but how else to do it...

* Name Game:

  Mynah: was really good idea
  Suha: yes it broke the ice

* Introduction Workshop part 1/2

  Suha: was a bit long, they were not sure why they were doing this
  Mynah: maybe make it more like a code along

* Introduction Workshop part 2/2

  Suha: was a bit dry for kids, they were tired before lunch, they lost interest really quick
  Mynah: make the examples in the workshop more dynamic, find more interesting `play` and `sleep` examples
  Suha: We feel we didnt do enough because they finished everything really quickly but it was actually intense for them

* Variables Workshop

  Suha: was good, they got more interested in that. Giving them time to do things on their own the first day is not
        such a good idea.
  Mynah: I agree


### Stop

  * Suha:   - leave them too much on their own
  * Mynah:  - counting on them to be independent
            - Pairs that are not going too well together

### Go

  * Suha: - Bring snacks for them
          - Make them move more in the class (gather around the computer to see a pair's work and code)
          - Give them specific things we want to see them do in the Exercises
          - Make them review in the morning to make sure everyone is on the same page
  * Mynah: - Have them show their work to the others **if they want**
          - lunch together at the guest house (give a safe space and community time)

### Continue

  * Suha: - name game on first Day
          - no pressure on them
  * Mynah: - amount of information from workshops is good, trust their intelligence
