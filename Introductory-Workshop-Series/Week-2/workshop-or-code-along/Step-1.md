# Step 1 - Variables and Conditional Statements

In Week 1, we discussed what are `variables` and how we declare them and we also looked at
conditional statements as a way to give more possibilities to our program. Now let's see
how we can put this into practice in a live coding context.

In this step, we are going to use variables combined with `if` statements to give us the choice of 2
possible melodies and bass lines. Once you've completed this step correctly, you should be able
to go from one possibility to the other by **changing only 1 value**, which is very handy when live coding.

## Tasks

- Declare a variable at the top of your file (after `use_bpm`). This variable will be a `boolean`, meaning it will have a value of `true` or `false`. Give it the value of `false` to start with.

- Inside the live loop `:melody`, write some code that allow you to change the value of the note `:e3` to `:eb3`
and `:e4` to `:eb4`.

- Inside the live loop `:bass`, write some code that allow you to change the value of the note `:a1` to `:ab1`.

:bulb: **Hints**:
- _What if the values inside the loops could change depending **if** your top variable is `true` or `false`?_

- _You'll need more variables inside the loops_
